# ðŸ“¸ CapTer: Capture your Terminal easily and share it with anyone

`capter` is a command line utility that lets you capture your current terminal wi an *application name* and *window title* in order to take a screenshot of a specific window.



## Justification and Use Case
Many times when I am working on some project and want to share my terminal output with someone.
The process included taking the screenshot using the keyboard shortcut, finding the screenshot, copying the screenshot and then finally sharing.
I thought why not create a small utility to make the process shorter and hence I created this.

To that end, I use this utility to generate and share screenshots of my terminal.

## Example
Just type `capter` in the terminal and that's it.
Take a screenshot of the current Terminal window and it gets copied to the clipboard automatically:

```bash
capter
```

## Installation
You will need Python 3.8+. Please install it with `brew` or `ports` if you do not have it already.

### PyPI
```bash
pip3 install capter
```

## Usage
`capter`

```
There are no options available as of now.
